<h3>
		What is a fractal?
</h3>
 </h4>
A fractal is an infinitely complex pattern that repeats at different scales, created through a simple, recursive process. 
These patterns, often linked to chaos, exist between familiar dimensions. Fractals are common in nature, appearing in trees, 
rivers, coastlines, mountains, clouds, and hurricanes.
Abstract fractals, like the Mandelbrot Set, can be generated by computers through repeated calculations of equations.
